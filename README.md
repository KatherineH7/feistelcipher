# feistelcipher
For our project, we created a powerpoint where we explain the Feistel Cipher's 
-history
-algorithm
-variants

We also created a tryhackme room with problems that we came up with ourselves. The room was meant to be brief and just to give people a better idea of how the cipher works.
